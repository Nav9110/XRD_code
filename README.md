# XRD Data Analysis for perovskite (MHP)

This Python script allows the analysis of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) data from .csv files containing measurements with 2θ and intensity columns. It provides several useful features for processing XRD spectra:

## 📌 Features

Import .csv files containing multiple XRD measurements

Peak features extracting :

Integration of the area under the curve between specific bounds

The maximum intensity of the peaks

The peak positions in 2θ

The FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum)


## 🔧 Usage

Load a .csv file containing 2θ and intensity columns.

Define integration boundaries if needed.

Retrieve computed values (area under the curve, peaks, FWHM, etc.).


## 📦 Dependencies

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
